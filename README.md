## Overview

Buttons enable rich cross-application functionality initiated from drop-in UI components, called Buttons! Buttons act as the entry point to highly-contextual, fully attributed actions across apps.

The Button SDK provides full functionality for both displaying Buttons and attributing incoming users from the Button marketplace.

Add a Button to your app, pass it some context and it will render & display itself. e.g...

## Getting the SDK

The best way to get the Button SDK is to use CocoaPods. If you don't already use CocoaPods, the <a target="out" href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html">CocoaPods Getting Started Guide</a> will have you managing dependencies in no time.

Add Button to your target by adding the following line to your `Podfile`.

```
pod "Button", "~> 4"
```

Alternatively, you can download the [latest Button framework](https://github.com/usebutton/button-ios/releases/latest) and follow the [Framework Integration Steps](https://github.com/usebutton/button-ios/wiki/Adding-the-Button-Framework-and-Bundle-to-your-project).
