## Getting the SDK

The best way to get the Button SDK is to use CocoaPods. If you don't already use CocoaPods, the <a target="out" href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html">CocoaPods Getting Started Guide</a> will have you managing dependencies in no time.

Add Button to your target by adding the following line to your `Podfile`.

```
pod "Button", "~> 6"
```
