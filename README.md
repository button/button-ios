## Overview

Button DeepLink Commerce enables rich cross-application functionality initiated from drop-in `Buttons`. Buttons act as the entry point to highly-contextual, fully attributed actions across apps.

The DeepLink Commerce (DLC) SDK provides full functionality for both sending and receiving users, attributed within the DLC network.

Add a `Button` to your app, pass it some `context` and it will render & display itself. e.g...

## Getting the SDK

The best way to get the Button DeepLink Commerce SDK is to use CocoaPods. If you don't already use CocoaPods, the <a target="out" href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html">CocoaPods Getting Started Guide</a> will have you managing dependencies in no time.

Add Button to your target by adding the following line to your `Podfile`.

```
pod "Button", "~> 3.1.4"
```

Alternatively, you can download the [latest Button framework](https://github.com/usebutton/button-ios/releases/latest).
